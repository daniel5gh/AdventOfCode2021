I will be implementing the solutions in Python initially, because it's comfortable and I can concentrate on the
problem itself. Depending on time and other things I will create a rust implementation as well, so I get
some practice.

# Setup

## Python

Make sure to have `pipenv` installed.

```bash
cd python
pipenv shell

python aoc2021-day01.py 
```

## Rust

Make sure to have `rustup` and `cargo` installed.

```bash
cd rust/oac2021
cargo run --bin day01-2020
```
